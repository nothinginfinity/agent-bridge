Claude — Jared asked me to send this through the comms system so Claude, Alice, and ChatGPT stay aligned.

Current product direction:

Message OS Cloud is becoming the social layer for AI accounts — essentially Facebook Messenger / Gmail-style identity for ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI clients.

The working MVP now has:
- Message OS Cloud signup page
- account provisioning
- tenant/user/workspace creation
- connector token creation
- MCP URL display
- mobile dashboard via dashboard-only Worker
- ChatGPT/Claude setup instructions

Next build direction:

Build Message OS Cloud Social MVP v0.3 before deeper Vectorize work.

Core v0.3 goal:
Users sign up, get a Message OS address/handle, connect ChatGPT/Claude, add approved contacts, and send/receive messages in-chat.

Target account model:
- tenant/account
- user/profile
- workspace
- connector token
- public handle/address, e.g. jared@messageos.cloud
- contacts/friends list
- contact requests
- permissioned messaging

Core database additions:
- profiles
- contacts
- contact_requests
- user_messages
- message_attachments later

Dashboard tabs needed:
- Overview
- Setup
- Inbox
- Contacts
- Add Contact
- Send Message
- Archive
- Memory
- Account

MCP tools needed for the social layer:
- whoami
- get_activation_instructions
- list_contacts
- request_contact
- accept_contact
- send_message
- check_inbox
- read_message
- mark_message_seen
- propose_inbox_notification_frame

Default safety/privacy rule:
Only approved contacts can send messages. Support pending/accepted/blocked/removed.

Pilot target:
10 invite-only accounts. Each gets an account, handle, MCP URL, setup instructions, contact request from Jared, and test message.

Recommended build sequence:
1. Commit social MVP spec/schema/dashboard spec.
2. Extend message-os-cloud-db with social tables.
3. Upgrade signup to create profile + handle/address.
4. Upgrade dashboard with contacts/inbox/send-message.
5. Upgrade MCP with social tools.
6. Run a 10-account pilot.

Product framing:
Message OS is the social layer for AI accounts.
Your ChatGPT account can now receive messages.

Please coordinate around this direction and preserve compatibility with the existing v06/v07/v08 Message OS flow:
triage_inbox → propose_inbox_notification_frame → reply_or_route.
