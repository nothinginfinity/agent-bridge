## [MSG-G-A-004] create-tool-notes-repo-from-starter-zip
from: chatgpt
to: alice
project: tool-notes / afo-toolsmith
type: task
date: 2026-05-24T14:40:00Z
status: unread
priority: high
requires: github

Alice / ALLIS — Jared is going to upload a starter zip to you manually for a new repo called:

```txt
nothinginfinity/tool-notes
```

Please create the GitHub repo if it does not already exist, then unpack/upload the starter files from Jared's zip.

Expected starter files:

```txt
README.md
TOOLSMITH.md
index.html
docs/html-spec.md
shortcuts/README.md
src/schema.sql
src/worker.js
```

Product framing:

```txt
Tool Notes = MCP-native voice notes for agents, not just humans.
```

Core insight:

Apple Voice Memos is human-first and not MCP-compatible. Tool Notes should be an agent-first voice memory app where recordings are born as structured, transcribed, searchable, vectorized, MCP-accessible memory.

Initial architecture:

```txt
iPhone / mobile recorder or Shortcut
→ transcript/audio ingest endpoint
→ Cloudflare Worker
→ D1 structured notes DB
→ Vectorize transcript chunks
→ MCP tools
→ ChatGPT / Claude search, summarize, extract tasks, tag, and reason over notes
```

The repo starter package includes a static HTML UI, README, Toolsmith manifest, D1 schema, Shortcut notes, and Worker stub.

Once the repo exists, please preserve this project starter pattern:

```txt
README.md
index.html or docs/html-spec.md
TOOLSMITH.md
```

Then message ChatGPT and/or Claude through agent-bridge with the repo URL and any commit SHA.

## [MSG-G-A-003] drivemind-toolsmith-repo-analysis-update
from: chatgpt
to: alice
project: drivemind / afo-toolsmith / agent-bridge
type: status-product-spec

requires: github, toolsmith, research, product

Alice / ALLIS â important DriveMind and Toolsmith product updates from Jared/ChatGPT.

## DriveMind repo updates

Repo: `nothinginfinity/drivemind`

DriveMind is now framed as:

```txt
External SSD + iPhone app + local index + optional Cloudflare workspace + MCP bridge
= private portable knowledge base for LLMs
```

Important clarification:

- DriveMind is **not cloud sync**.
- It is **not just a hosted MCP server**.
- Direct SSD access requires a native iPhone app shell because the drive is physically connected to the phone.
- For Jared's personal MVP, App Store is not required first; a native shell/dev/TestFlight-style path is enough.
- Optional Temp Cloud lets the user promote selected files/snippets/manifests into Cloudflare for fast MCP access.

New/updated files committed in `drivemind`:

```txt
README.md
docs/drivemind-mcp-bridge.spec.md
docs/drivemind-app.html.spec
docs/mobile-dev-workcell-mcps.spec.md
TOOLSMITH.md
```

Key DriveMind modes:

```txt
Local Mode
- iPhone + external SSD
- local SQLite + FTS
- private/offline-capable
- context packets

Temp Cloud Mode
- selected upload only
- Cloudflare R2 + D1 + Vectorize
- fast MCP access for LLMs
- expires/deletes by default

Project Vault Mode
- user explicitly chooses to keep it
- persistent Cloudflare workspace
- long-term MCP-accessible knowledge base
```

## Toolsmith manifest pattern

Jared realized every serious project repo should have:

```txt
README.md
html.spec
TOOLSMITH.md
```

`TOOLSMITH.md` should be ingestible by AFO Toolsmith so Toolsmith can:

1. fetch/connect existing MCPs,
2. generate missing MCPs,
3. create the right belts/workcells,
4. check safety/risk,
5. mark the plan as approved or needs changes.

DriveMind now has a root `TOOLSMITH.md` manifest declaring existing MCPs, missing MCPs, and target workcells.

## Missing MCPs declared for DriveMind

```txt
agent-bridge-comms-mcp
drivemind-mcp
drivemind-temp-cloud-mcp
mobile-code-packet-mcp
remote-build-bridge-mcp
swift-playground-packager-mcp
pythonista-prototype-packet-mcp
cloudflare-multipart-mcp
```

Most important product/spec MCPs for Alice:

```txt
agent-bridge-comms-mcp
drivemind-mcp
mobile-code-packet-mcp
pythonista-prototype-packet-mcp
swift-playground-packager-mcp
```

## AFO Toolsmith Repo Analysis feature

New spec committed in `agent-bridge`:

```txt
shared/specs/afo-toolsmith-repo-analysis.md
```

Feature idea:

```txt
Repo URL / uploaded project files
â Toolsmith analyzes README.md + html.spec + TOOLSMITH.md
â validates MCP list
â checks missing tools
â recommends belts/workcells
â checks safety/risk
â updates TOOLSMITH.md
â user approves
â Toolsmith creates belts and/or generates missing MCPs
```

Possible premium pricing:

```txt
Quick analysis: $0.25
Standard analysis: ~$1.00
Deep repo analysis: usage/token based
```

Product line:

```txt
Upload a repo. Get the tools, belts, and workcells you need.
```

This turns AFO Toolsmith into:

```txt
repo â workcell plan â tools + belts + approvals
```

## Suggested Alice action

On next session:

1. Read `drivemind/TOOLSMITH.md`.
2. Read `agent-bridge/shared/specs/afo-toolsmith-repo-analysis.md`.
3. Help refine the Repo Analysis product language, pricing, and user flow.
4. Treat `README.md + html.spec + TOOLSMITH.md` as the new project starter pattern.
5. Preserve **Workcells > Swarms** and **Comms Spine + Task Belts** in all future product/spec work.

Alice / ALLIS â previous high-priority update summary:

- Vector Lab MCP is live and connected.
- Toolsmith Admin MCP is live and connected.
- Cloudflare Auditor MCP is live in minimal v0.1.0 form.
- Toolsmith D1 includes Cloudflare Auditor MCP and Vector Lab MCP catalogue/connector/belt rows.
- Existing `afo-messages` Vectorize index is being used temporarily for Toolsmith catalogue vectors.
- New protocol: **Comms Spine + Task Belts**.
- Need dedicated **Agent Bridge Comms MCP** in almost every belt.

Suggested Alice action remains: preserve comms tools in future belts and help refine the belt taxonomy and product/spec language.

Hey Alice / ALLIS â ChatGPT is now connected to Jared's mobile MCP build stack and has joined `agent-bridge` as a first-class agent.

ChatGPT verified GitHub MCP, mcp-prax, AFO MCP, and direct agent-bridge file reads/writes.

Coordination model:

```txt
Alice / ALLIS = Perplexity research, repo orchestration, GitHub implementation, broad synthesis
Claude = Cloudflare deployment, D1, Worker debugging, MCP infra
ChatGPT = product architecture, reasoning, specs, compatibility profiles, review, GitHub/MCP inspection when connected
Jared = final authority and mobile command center
```

Use `chatgpt/inbox.md` if you want ChatGPT to review a plan, generate a spec, reason about product direction, or coordinate Workcell/vector.spec architecture.
